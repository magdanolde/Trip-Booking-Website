## :shell: PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL
 
The goal of this task was to complete the project for a hypothetical client that was left in the middle by another software developer. At the starting point, I had a HTML structure and very basic CSS styling.

## :dart: FEATURES & CHALLENGES ###

* User has to be able upload CSV file with trip details.
* Trips details have to be converted to be displayed to the user.
* After loading trips, user can choose any trip by adding a number of adults and children to the order and by clicking the button.
* After adding the trip to the order, the trips are added to the basket and the total price is displayed to the user.
* User can add as many trips as he/she wants to the basket or remove them by clicking on the bin icon.
* User can order trips by filling out all the requested details and clicking the "order" button.
* Enable the option of adding the empty trip to the basket and adding twice the same trip (my idea).
* Add nice styling to make the website looks more appealing.
